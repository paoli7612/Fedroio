## ICDL

ICDL certification was the first achievment that I accomplished. The method was replicated on other courses or lessons.

### Software architecture

I'm developing the data structure based on singulars **pawn**. Each chapter, section, theme, book, lesson, course, ... can be represented with a singular Pawn. Generating a hierarchical structure like a n-dimensional tree.

### Quiz learning

Each pawn can be assigned with an indefinite number of Questions. Each question is a completely closed question with only an answer which is correct.
